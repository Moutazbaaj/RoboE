 """# ðŸ¤– Emotion Bot â€“ ESP32 Sound Reactive OLED + LED + DAC Project

The **Emotion Bot** is a fun and expressive ESP32-powered robot that reacts to ambient sound using:
- ðŸŽ¤ An **INMP441 I2S microphone** to measure sound level (dB)
- ðŸ–¥ A **0.96" OLED screen** to show emotional states
- ðŸŒˆ An **addressable LED strip (WS2812B)** to reflect mood with smooth color transitions

## ðŸ“Š Mood Mapping by Sound Level (dB)

| dB Range | Mood         | Description                                  | LED Color      |
|----------|--------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------|
| < 20     | `SLEEPY`     | Super quiet, maybe no oneâ€™s here             | White          |
| 20â€“30    | `DISAPPOINTED` | Dead room vibe                              | Pale white     |
| 30â€“40    | `CONFOUNDED` | Confusingly quiet                            | Cool green     |
| 40â€“50    | `CONFUSED`   | Low chatter or hum                           | Light green    |
| 50â€“60    | `GRINNING`   | People talking, warming up                   | Lime green     |
| 60â€“70    | `KISSING`    | Romantic or soft music atmosphere            | Yellow         |
| 70â€“80    | `HAPPY`      | Peak vibes, ideal party zone                 | Orange         |
| â‰¥ 80     | `ANGRY+`     | Too loud â€“ starts turning RED progressively  |  Red tones   |

##  Components Used

- [x] ESP32 Mini D1 (or compatible)
- [x] INMP441 I2S Microphone
- [x] 0.96" OLED (SSD1306, I2C)
- [x] WS2812B LED Strip (NeoPixel)
- [x] Optional: Pull-up resistors for I2C

## ðŸ”§ Setup & Libraries

Install these libraries from Arduino Library Manager:

```cpp
FastLED
Adafruit_SSD1306
Adafruit_GFX
I2S
Wire
```

Configure I2C and I2S pins properly. Example for INMP441:
```cpp
#define I2S_WS  15
#define I2S_SD  32
#define I2S_SCK 14
```

---

##  Logic Overview

```cpp
1. Read mic data via I2S â†’ convert to dB
2. Determine emotion based on dB thresholds
3. Update OLED expression
4. Set LED strip color (white â†’ green â†’ red scale)
```
